      "    *   **Next Semester/Term:** If it's too late for this term, you can usually plan to enroll for the next one.\n",
      "    *   **Auditing:** Some courses allow auditing, where you attend without getting credit. This might be an option if you just want the knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **For Online Courses (MOOCs, independent platforms):**\n",
      "    *   **Self-Paced:** Many online courses are self-paced, meaning you can join anytime.\n",
      "    *   **Cohort-Based:** Others are run in cohorts with specific start and end dates. If you've missed the start of a cohort, you might have to wait for the next one.\n",
      "    *   **Open Enrollment:** Check the course platform; they usually clearly state if enrollment is open.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **For Community/Hobby Classes (Art, Cooking, Fitness, etc.):**\n",
      "    *   **Session-Based:** Many are run in sessions (e.g., \"6-week beginner pottery\"). You might have to wait for the next session to start.\n",
      "    *   **Drop-in:** Some allow drop-ins, meaning you can join any time.\n",
      "    *   **Contact the Organizer:** This is usually the best way to find out if they can accommodate you.\n",
